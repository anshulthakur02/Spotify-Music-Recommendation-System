# Spotify-Music-Recommendation-System
In this project I performed clustering on the Spotify dataset and developed a recommendation system for the users. I had a dataset of songs and their features like danceability, energy, etc. The goal was to perform clustering on the dataset and then recommend songs to the users based on the clusters.
